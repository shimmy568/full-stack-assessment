# full-stack-assessment

Test project made with nextjs and strapi

# Things to Improve

- Load API key for environment variable or file, not have it hardcoded.
- Use an NGINX instance so that the compiled frontend code and the strapi backend API can be accessed through the same endpoint/port
- Make it so the FAQ items slide out when toggled instead of just appearing
- add i18n
